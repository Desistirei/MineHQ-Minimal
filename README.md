# What is this repo?
This is a repo you can use to download source codes to run MineHQ's Practice.

# Why is it called "MineHQ-Minimal?"
It's simple: The sources included here are the bare minimum both to compile and run the Practice.

# Are you sure its the bare minimum?
No. But these were the plugins I compiled to have a working practice test server.

# What is included?
- Basic (Sort of a server core, sort of a server helper)
- Bridge (Rank, Punishments and etc.)
- BukkitAPI (Lunar Client API)
- BukkitAPI-NetHandler (A dependency for BukkitAPI)
- CheatbreakerAPI (Name is self-explanatory, but its a API for Cheatbreaker)
- mSpigot (Server Spigot)
- qLib (Libraries for most of the projects here)
>And last but not least:
- Practice (Practice core)
